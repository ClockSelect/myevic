### Main Screen
* Double-click:

    A double fire click switches between standard view and clock screen.  
    The clock screen is close to the one viewed on the VTwo box; just better, imo.  
    See below the Clock menu to know how to configure clock.

    - Board temperature
    - Real-time clock
    - Real-time atomizer resistance
    - Estimate of vape velocity in ml or ml/day *(experimental)*

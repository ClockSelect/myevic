### Changes in behavior ###
Some changes has been made to the overall behavior of the firmware from the original. This paragraph may be read by any new user not to think something is a "bug".

* Stealth mode:  
  The stealth mode has been extended to some more screens.  
  The battery charging screen does no longer show up in stealth mode; only for a few seconds when plugging in the USB cable, just to show it's been correctly plugged.  
  The Key Lock/UnLock screen reverts to black screen if keys are locked.  
  The Stealth On/Off screen goes to black when setting stealth On.

* Right (+) and Left (-) buttons:  
  While editing some values, the speed of change has been made more progressive before reaching the insane terminal velocity.  
  Pressing those buttons does no longer wake up the box from screen saving, except if configured to do so in the Interface menu (see below). This makes the box more pocket-proof.

* Temperature setting in TEMP mode:  
  The temperature no longer wraps-around by switching between °C and °F; the temperature unit has to be chosen once and for all in the Interface menu. Default is °C.  
  The temperature setting can vary by +/1 °C or +/-5 °F when edited if configured to do so in the Interface menu (see below).

* Fire button Multi-Clicks:  
  Clicking rapidly 2, 3 or 4 times on the fire button may now have some effect - see below in the Interface menu description to see those effects and how to set (or unset) them up.  
  Clicking 10 times for board temperature, or 20 times for version screen does no longer require to switch off the box.  

* Coils memory:  
  In POWER mode, the box now reminds of the power setting for any given resistance, up to 10 different (just like in SMART mode). Thus, when swapping between your tanks, the box will automatically set up the power setting you previously entered for that particular coil.  
  Coils may vary by +/-10% in resistance to still be recognized, and two different coils within 10% won't be distinguished.
  The coils memory can be erased in the Coils >> Manage >> Zero All menu item (see below).

* Bypass mode:  
  Power is now displayed on top of screen instead of voltage, as it's a more relevant information regarding vaping quality. Real-time output voltage information is still available as a third-line option (VOUT).  
  Predicted power and voltage are also more accurate, especially on multi-cells boxes. It needs a few puffs to reach max accuracy, time for the box to estimate battery behavior under high load.

* Logo:  
  The myevic firmware accepts logos sizes of 64 pixels wide and from 40 to 63 lines high. Tall logo may partially recover lines of information in the center of the screen; it's up to you to choose the correct design and dimensions so that the display looks fine.

* Menus:  
  Menus accessed by pressing Fire and Right button have been completely revamped. See below for new menus description.

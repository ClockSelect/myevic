### Profiles

You can switch between seven different configuration profiles. 
A Profile stores all data relevant to vaping configuration; that is, vaping mode, coils resistance, preheat and algo settings, etc. Interface, display or others non vape-related settings are not reloaded when switching profiles.

To access the Profile selection screen, press and hold the Fire and (+) buttons for two seconds. On the Profile selection screen, select the profile and click Fire to activate it.

Each line display the Profile number, the selected mode and last used resistance.  
Empty lines correspond to empty profiles.  
* Create a new profile:  
  Select an empty profile and single click it. The current profile will be duplicated into the selected one. The selected profile will be made active and the box will return to the main screen.
* Erase a profile:
  Select a non-empty profile and long click it (press fire for two seconds). The selected profile will be erased. Currently active profile (the highlighted line) cannot be erased. This won't return you to the main screen so you can delete several profiles in a row.
* Duplicate current profile:
  Select an empty profile and long click it (press fire for two seconds). The currently active profile will be duplicated into the selected profile. The selected profile will be made the active profile. This won't return you back to the main screen, allowing you to easily move profiles around by deleting/duplicating them if you wish to reorganize them.  

To exit Profile selection menu, select a profile or click Fire and (+) buttons.

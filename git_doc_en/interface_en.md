### Interface

![Interface menu screen](http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p374/ClockSelect/eVic/interface_zpshqw8kg89.png)

 * __1Watt On/Off__

   Enable increment of power setting by plus ±1.0 Watt instead of ±0.1 Watts.

  * __1C/5F On/Off__
  
    Enable increment of temperature setting by ±1°C and ±5°F instead of ±5°C and ±10°F

  * __Wake < > On/Off__

    Enable/Disable box wake up from sleep mode when pressing the + or - button.

  * Font A/B

    Change the display font. You have two fonts available; choose what pleases you more. Choice is purely aesthetic. One may find the bolder font B more readable on some displays.

  * __Temp °C/°F__

    Choose once and for all your temperature unit, between °C and °F. Nobody needs to switch back and forth between standards. Moreover, Farenheit is not even a standard. Maybe I'll replace it by Kelvins one day. Changing temperature unit by wrapping around the temperature has been disabled.

  * __PPwr On/Off__
  
    *__TEMP Mode Only__*  
    Toggle Priority Power mode On/Off. In temperature control modes, this switches the power and the temperature display; the power is displayed at top of screen and is directly editable by the + and - keys just like in Power mode, and the temperature is displayed on the first of the 3 informations lines in the center of the screen. Temperature remains editable in Edit mode.  
    The purpose of this function is near the preheat function in PWR mode; once you have set your correct vape temperature (not burning your dry cotton), your comfort come from the heat rise speed. This feature let you adjust this parameter more easily.

  * __Clicks__
  
    ![Clicks Menu](http://i345.photobucket.com/albums/p374/ClockSelect/clicks_zpsoqy6ngvh.png)
        
    The Clicks submenu allows you to configure the action associated to a Fire button multi-clic. Configurable multi-clicks are double, triple and quadruple clicks.

    Possible actions are:
        * Nothing
        * Enter edit mode
        * Toggle display of info lines / clock on the main display
        * Toggle the "Priority Power" mode (basically, switches temperature and power on the main screen display in TC mode, see above "PPwr On/Off" doc), *OR* enters the Preheat menu if box is in POWER mode.
        * Switch to next vaping mode ( TC -> POWER -> BYPASS -> ... )
        * Switch box On or Off
        * Cycle through configuration profiles

    As a security feature, if none of the action are configured to be the "Edit" mode, the firmware will redefine the triple click action to "Edit" at next reset.

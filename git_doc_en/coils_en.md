* __On each line of the four TC modes:__

  Click fire to toggle edit mode on the resistance.  
  While the resistance value is highlighted, click (+) and (-) to edit its value.  
  If you click fire again without editing the resistance value, this will toggle its locked/unlocked status.  
  Editing the resistance to any non-zero value automaticaly locks it.  
  Setting the resistance to zero with (-) will unlock and reset it.  
               
  You may also fire two seconds on one of the four resistances to reset its value; if the selected resistance corresponds to the current vaping mode, this will force an immediate reading of the atomizer, setting and lock of the new value.  
-----              
When entering the Coils Management menu, the resistance corresponfing to the current vaping mode (if applicable) will be pre-selected.

* __Zero All__

  Zeroes all resistances; also zeroes all "SMART" and "POWER" modes saved resistance settings.

* __Check: Yes/No__

  If you feel you need to use this feature in any other situation than a really heavy build with low TCR value (SS and such), you surely have an issue with your coil. Using this feature may be risky and therefore is not recommended. Check your build first.*  

  In TC modes, the box checks for suitability of the resistance the first time it is fired (i.e. each time the atomizer in screwed on or after box reset). The test is done in a way that can make heavy builds with low TCR value fail the test (really heavy, like dual twisted clapton or such; more than around 1.7 grams of metal). If a coil fails the first fire test, the box will enforce the power mode.  
  If you know your heavy build is well done and suitable for temp control, you may set this option to "No". The box will bypass the first fire test and let you vape in the selected temp control mode.  

    __Keeping the coil test disabled may get you into unpleasant situations. Use wisely.__

* __TCR Submenu__

  *This menu is also accessible by switching off the box and pressing both Fire and Right regulatory button (+) for 5 seconds.*  
        
   In addition to the three usual TCR modes (M1, M2 & M3), the box standard presets for TEMP NI, TI and SS are editable. To edit one of the three preset modes:
   * Select the mode you want to edit,
   * Long fire to unlock the default (DEF) behavior; a reasonable value is proposed as a default starting value for edition,
   * Edit the TCR value.
   * Long fire to restore the default (DEF) behavior if needed.
